# BMI-Calculator
 BMI Calculation: The calculator takes the user's height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) as input and calculates the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height^2).  BMI Categorization: After calculating the BMI, the program categorizes the result into different weight categories based on standard BMI ranges. These categories include Underweight (BMI < 18.5), Normal Weight (18.5 <= BMI < 25), Overweight (25 <= BMI < 30), and Obese (BMI >= 30).  Data Handling: The project includes functionality to save BMI records to a text file (bmi_records.txt) and load previous records from the file. This allows users to keep track of their BMI history and monitor changes over time.
